TODO LIST:

Get prefixes for PRIVMSG's to the bot to be ignored
Add hooks for the registration API
Allow modules to force a 'core' mode (no unload, higher priority)
Allow disabling of module_downloader, registration, login etc. (Mostly done, need to fix a few bugs)
Getting the hostmasks of other users.
